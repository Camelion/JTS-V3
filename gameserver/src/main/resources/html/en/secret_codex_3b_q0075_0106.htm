<body>Tablet of Vision:
<br>An incomprehensible knowledge digs into your head. You think you hear a woman's voice from somewhere.
<br>And you see the image of a man. He worries about the impending eternal winter, and he holds the Resonance Amulet and waits for a worthy person to come find him.
<br>He is Seer Skahi at the Orc Guild in Goddard Castle Town.</body></html>
