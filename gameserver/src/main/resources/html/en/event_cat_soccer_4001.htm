<body>Tony The Cat:<br>Ahem! Cough! Welcome! Meow!<br>Pardon me, I cheered so much that I've lost my voice! Meow! My name's Tony, and I love soccer more than anything!<br>I love all the games, but the World Cup is my all-time favorite competition!<br>The roar of the crowd and the tension of a close game makes my heart beat so fast that I feel like I might faint! It's a great way to relieve stress!<br>Therefore, I've quit my job so I'll have more time to follow the games! I've started selling Boxes of Cheerleading Gear to help our team advance. Meow!<br>By the way, have you heard? Our mighty Taeguk Warriors have made to the semi-finals! Meow!<br>I've even reduced the price of my boxes so more people can cheer on our team! I"m calling the event the <font color="LEVEL">Viva Victory Korea Event</font>! Meow!<br>If you have any questions, just ask me! Meow!<br><a action="link event_cat_soccer_4002.htm">"Tell me more about the event."</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-303&reply=555">"I'd like to buy a Box of Cheerleading Gear."</a></body></html>
