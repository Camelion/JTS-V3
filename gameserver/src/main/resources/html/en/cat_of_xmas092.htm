<html><head><body>Cat of Christmas:<br>That Turkey is not a normal bird. <br>It's completely invulnerable -- even your most powerful weapon won't so much as ruffle one of its feathers. Its one weakness is its addiction to rock-paper-scissors.<br>Thanks to the hat I gave you, you can use the rock-paper-scissors skill to beat it at its own game and win Santa's freedom.<br>Don't forget, <font color="LEVEL">timing</font> is key. <br>If your timing is wrong, the skill will be useless.<br>Furthermore, one win won't be enough. You need 5 consecutive wins to set Santa free.<br><br><a action="link cat_of_xmas001.htm">Back</a></body></html>
