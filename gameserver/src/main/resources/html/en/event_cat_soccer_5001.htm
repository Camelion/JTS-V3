<body>Tony The Cat:<br>Welcome! My name's Tony, and I just love soccer! Meow!<br>I love all games, but the World Cup is my all-time favorite competition!<br>The roar of the crowd and the tension of a close game makes my heart beat so fast that I feel like I might faint! It's a great way to relieve stress!<br>Therefore, I've quit my job so I'll have more time to follow the games! I've started selling Boxes of Cheerleading Gear to help our team advance. Meow!<br>By the way, have you heard? Our mighty Taeguk Warriors won the semi-finals! Meow! I'm so excited by all of this I could almost explode! Meow!<br>I'm going to sell these boxes day and night until our team wins the finals! Meow!<br>I'm calling the event the <font color="LEVEL">Viva Victory Korea Event</font>! Meow!<br>If you have any questions, just ask me! Meow! I've even dropped the price 4000 Adena! That's no mere discount! I'm practically giving them away!<br><a action="link event_cat_soccer_5002.htm">"Tell me more about the event."</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-303&reply=556">"I'd like to buy a Box of Cheerleading Gear."</a></body></html>
