Captain Mouen:<br>Young traveler, welcome to Oren! I am Mouen, responsible to the lord for the security of the town.<br>As you know, we are close to Aden's enemy, the land of Elmore, so security is tighter here than in most towns. Let me apologize now for any inconvenience this may cause you.<br>Please understand, the residents here are not very different in either appearance or customs, to our neighbors to the north. In fact, to those who make their living cutting down trees, national boundaries mean little. Off the top of my head, I can name at least 10 residents who have relatives or friends in Elmore!<br>That imposing castle on the northern hill, that's Oren Castle. Whenever I look at it, I pray that Elmore recognizes its power so our residents will not have to suffer the calamity of war ever again.<br><a action="link kamaroka_help.htm">Ask about Kamaloka.</a><br><a action="link kamaroka_level.htm">View the list of Kamaloka.</a><br><a action="link mouen010.htm">Enter Kamaloka.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">Ask about the local lord and tax rate.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest.</a></body></html>
