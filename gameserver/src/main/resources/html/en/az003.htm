Magister Gaius:<br>I am afraid that I cannot take you on as a student. But why don't you go upstairs? Gauen is relatively young compared to the other Elves, but he is already a very good teacher. Kaiena, on the other hand, can be somewhat prickly, but there is no denying his excellence as a wizard.<br>Ah, one more thing. We cannot train priests here; if that is your calling, you must go to the Temple.</body></html>
