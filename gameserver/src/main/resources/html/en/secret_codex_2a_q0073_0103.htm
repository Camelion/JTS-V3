<body>Tablet of Vision:<br>An incomprehensible knowledge digs into your head. You think you hear a woman's voice from somewhere.
<br>Then, you feel it. It is an image of a duelist who began training to become invincible, but fell into temptation and ended up making a deal with the devil.
<br>His name is Ancient Sword Master Iron. From end to end, he waits for offerings in front of the tablet, to prevent a duelist stronger than him from appearing.
<br>And the place where he waits is the southeast corner of the Ketra Orc stronghold!</body></html>
