<body>Tablet of Vision:<BR>A sharp blast of knowlege courses through your cranium! A 
vision appears of a black knight!<BR>There's a woman trying to prevent a man 
from getting the power of the dragon.<BR>White wings and the overwhelming 
presence of power! This is similar to the fear of a soldier facing the Lord of 
War on the battlefield. <BR>But the descendants of dragons have nothing to fear, 
like Leona. <BR>The Tablet of Vision can be found in the southern part of the 
Forest of the Dead where Leona is!</BODY></HTML>
