Warehouse Keeper Cliff: <br>Oh, welcome, welcome. Isn't that heavy? Lay down your belongings here....<br>This warehouse is run by the Association of the Dwarf Banks institute! The most reliable group in all the world - the moment you deposit items here, and until you come to get it, CLINK! Locked away! You've heard all manner of stories, I'm sure, from wars to heartbreak to treachery and conspiracy, but have you ever heard of a dwarven warehouse being robbed? No. No you haven't.<br><center><a action="link storage_people.htm">Private warehouse</a><br><a action="link storage_clan.htm">Clan warehouse</a><br><a action="bypass -h learn_skill">Learn skill</a><br><a action="link g_cube_warehouse001.htm"><font color="LEVEL">Wondrous Cubic</font></a><br><a action="link welcomeback001.htm">Dormant account support</a><br><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></center></body></html>
