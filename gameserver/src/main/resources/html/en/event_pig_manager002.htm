<html><head><body>Bonny:<br>The greed of some people just amazes me. If they left well enough alone, none of this would have happened.  What is done is done.  I need your help in freeing the poor fools who decided to steal from my grandfather.  He's ruthless, but also has a sense of humor.  The curse is a transformation from man to pig.  It's rendered the thieves harmless, but they've still managed to cause a great deal of chaos.  If you were able to free these swine and retrieve the coins they have stolen, I would be very happy.  Grandpa Zaken is a bear to deal with even when he's not off cursing everyone.<br>Would you be willing to help me? You would? Excellent! Then let me tell you how to remove the curse. <br>The cursed pigs are scattered all over town. Ah, there's one running around right now! You must lift the spell they're under by shooting them with a <font color="LEVEL">Redemption Bow</font>. When you have the bow equipped, you can use the skills <font color="LEVEL">Forgiveness or Pardon</font> to shoot them. It's no use using other weapons, or even other bows. Only a Redemption Bow -- which I happen to have for sale -- will work. <br>But alas! I only have a limited supply, so I'm afraid you can only buy a Redemption Bow once every <font color="LEVEL">24 hours </font>.  You get 3 bows with a one hour use on each.<br>But don't worry! I'll reward you by exchanging the coins you retrieve with other items that grandpa Zaken doesn't really need anymore.<font color="LEVEL">  Enchant Weapon Scrolls, High-Grade Life Stones, Circlets</font> and many other presents! I should mention, I suppose, that sometimes -- infrequently, I assure you -- a group of huge cursed pigs can transform into a <font color="LEVEL">super huge cursed pig</font>. Should that happen, it would be wise for you to work with a team. Oh, there are also a number of golden cursed pigs who will give you a very rare, very lucky currency called <font color="LEVEL">Golden Apiga</font>.<br><a action="link event_pig_manager001.htm">Back.</a></body></html>
