They say that the monsters you should collect souls from are in <font color="LEVEL">Northern Oren, the Forest of Mirrors, Giants' Cave, the Devastated Castle, the Upper Level of the Tower of Insolence, Watcher's Tomb, the Garden of Eva and Devil's Isle</font>. If you meet Blacksmiths while carrying the Soul Crystal and a weapon with the souls, they will bestow special features on to the weapon.<br>Building your strength is more important now ever before. I believe you will become powerful enough to resist the upcoming threats if you collect your greatest powers. I hope you become more powerful between now and when I see you next...<br><a action="link guyder_q0350_12.htm">Ask about the monsters that give out their souls.</a></body></html>
