<body>Black Cat:<br>When I was a member of the Hunter Guild, I challenged the Forbidden Power of the gods, the sort far beyond the means of mortals. I failed...
<br>I was unable to challenge the power again, so broken was I, and I was forced out of the guild by those who envied me, the one who dared challenge a higher power...
<br>It almost broke my spirit.
<br>But then I thought, all is not lost, if I can help another achieve what I could not. So after a long struggle of wills, I regained a place of leadership in the guild. The person that I wanted did not appear while I occupied that position. So I resigned with the promise from the succeeding guild president that I would receive potential candidates every week.
<br>I don't care to speak ill of the man, but he's squandering his promise on coin collecting.
<br>So then, are you ready for a test? Are you willing to take the risk as I did, and hope you don't end up a wrecked old man like me?
