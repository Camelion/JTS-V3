<html><head><body>Antique Dealer Patrin:<br>It has come to my attention that the Orc seer Reva of the Town of Aden is collecting Ancient Ash Urns. I asked him to give them to me so that I could sell them for a handsome price to antique collectors. He refused my offer, insisting that he needed them for a ritual! He promised me that if he finds an urn that does not contain any remains he would send it to me. Have you brought me such an item?<br><a action="link patrin_q0371_01a.htm">"Tell me about the appraisal."</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=371&reply=1">"Please appraise the urn."</a></body></html>
