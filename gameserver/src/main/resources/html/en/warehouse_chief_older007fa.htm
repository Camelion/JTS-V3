Warehouse Chief Alder:<br>If you want to be a Scavenger, you must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test. <br>To take the test, speak with <font color="LEVEL">Collector Pippi in the Dwarven Village</font>. Pass her test and she'll give you a proof. Bring it to me and I'll make you a Scavenger right away.  <br><a action="link warehouse_chief_older003f.htm">Return</a></body></html>
