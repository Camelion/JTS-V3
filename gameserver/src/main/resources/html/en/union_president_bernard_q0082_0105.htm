<html><head><body>Hunters Guild President Bernard: <br>Uh . . . well, the thing is, you see, that <br>The Bow of Sagittarius, the symbol of our guild, was stolen. <br>As you know, the bow can only be viewed by the public during daylight hours. Each evening, I myself place it into the guild's safe. <br>But yesterday, I was perusing some of my newly acquired coins and was a little late in putting the bow into the safe . . .<br>Hey now! Don't jumpt to conclusions! I was only briefly delayed. <br>I'm almost certain that this must be some sort of plot to get me into trouble. You'll discover, my young friend, as I have, that there are always those jealous of successful, accomplished men like myself. Perhaps one of those talentless ingrates is trying to tarnish my good reputation . . . <br>Do you understand the predicament I'm in? On behalf of your guild, I ask you, whose name and exploits are already well known throughout the land, to help recover the bow and preserve my honor. <br>You won't turn your back on me, will you? <br><a action="bypass -h quest_accept?quest_id=<?quest_id?>"> Tell him that you will help him. </a></body></html>
