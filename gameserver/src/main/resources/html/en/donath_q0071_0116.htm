<body>Chef Donath:<br> Here is the ice of purity made with the purest of water.  Long ago, while seeking high quality water, I asked Master Bronwyn for advice.  He taught me this method.  First you must find the purest water. <br> Since I couldn't find the Ice Crystal on my own, I put aside the information for later use.  Now, return to Master Bronwyn. </body></html>
