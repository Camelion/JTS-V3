<html><head> <body>Priest Dominic:<br> Here's the quest: Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Monastery of Silence</font> and vanquish the monks. I will give you a reward if you bring me the <font color="LEVEL">Scripture of Monk</font> as proof that you have defeated them. I hope, of course, that they surrender to you, but if they do not, you may kill them in good conscience; we will pray for their souls.<br> Oh, here's something that may help you: we have a man on the inside. Our brave <font color="LEVEL">Greymore</font> has managed to infiltrate the monastery, a task many had thought impossible. Please help him to escape if possible; the poor man has done more than enough, and he may be of help to you.<br> <a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=639&reply=2">Continue the job.</a><br> <a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=639&reply=4">Quit the job.</a></body></html>
