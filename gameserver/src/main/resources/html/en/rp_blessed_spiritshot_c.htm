[Create Blessed Spiritshot – C Grade]
</center>
<br>
The Blessed Spiritshot - C Grade is used in conjunction with another C Grade weapon. It is a support-type magic item that greatly increases a weapon's M. Atk. Since it has the effect of increasing one's magic casting speed and many high-level Mystics use the spiritshot to cast more powerful magic, manufacturing spiritshot can be very profitable to Dwarves. Item creation requires the skill of a master Artisan.
