<html><head><body>Seer Reva:<br>Congratulations on your safe return, young soldier! Word has come that the tower has become a chaotic entanglement of angels and demons.  I trust that you have recovered many of the <font color="LEVEL">Ancient Ash Urns</font> from Hallate's warriors, knights and commanders!<br>The <font color="LEVEL">Ancient Porcelain</font> you brought doesn't contain any remains. It was only used for decoration! It's no good to me, you can keep it for yourself! Either sell it at a store or take it to <font color="LEVEL">antique dealer Patrin</font>! He is at the general store in the Town of Oren.<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=371&reply=1">Hand over the Ancient Ash Urns.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=371&reply=2">Settle the account later.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=371&reply=3">"I want to quit."</a></body></html>
