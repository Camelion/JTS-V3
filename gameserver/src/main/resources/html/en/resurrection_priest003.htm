Upon wearing 'Seal Removal Bracelet_Towbet', you must wait 30 minutes before acquiring proof that you existed. How much proof? Well... 30-er, 70-uh, 50. Yes, you will need to collect 50 of them! Be warned after 1 day of wearing the Seal Removal Bracelet, ONLY THEN can you receive... the "Proof of Time and Space." What?  You don't have a Seal Removal Bracelet? How embarassing. If you ask nicely and select "Receive Seal Removal Bracelet" I can give you one.<br><br><br><br><a action="link resurrection_priest001.htm">Back</a></body></html>
