Warehouse Keeper Radic:<br>No, I've looked several times and there is nothing here registered to you. Our warehouse is absolutely secure... Why anyone would want to use places like the Forbidden Gateway or the Seal of Mitraell is beyond me...  If they had deposited it here at our warehouse it would have been just as safe... <br>Oh, you're still here? I have nothing for you!</body></html>
