<html><head><body>Magister Hanellin:<BR>Do you remember when I mentioned the bloodless 
angels? There is something I must tell you... That wasn't exactly true. When 
angels return to heaven, their physical bodies disappear. During this process a 
large amount of pure water is produced... This is known as the "blood of an 
angel." It cannot be contained in any vessel, it must be soaked into a piece of 
fabric...<BR>And although I cannot speak their names, even to you, there are 
many people who would do anything to obtain the "blood of an angel". <br><br><A
