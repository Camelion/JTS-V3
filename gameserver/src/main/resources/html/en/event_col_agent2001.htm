<body>Event Manager Winnie the Cat:<br>Meow! I'm Winnie the Cat!
<br>By the request of that rich and famous collector Bechtel of the Bronze Key Guild, I'm collecting medals that are scattered around the world. So I'm here at this village as Bechtel's representative, Mew!
<br>We can't collect all those medals on our own, so we've been getting help from lots of people by making it an event of sorts. We're calling it <font color="LEVEL">Find it? Collect it! Medal collecting event!</font> We take the medals that people collect and trade them for premiums, meow! So if you have medals, take them to Roy over there!
<br> Prr, telling you all that took a lot out of me. I just wanna go hide somewhere and take a nap, meow. What are you and what do you need? Prr, purr ...
