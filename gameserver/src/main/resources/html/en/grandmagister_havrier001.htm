Grand Magister Javier:<br>Pleased to met you. I am Grand Magister Javier. Ah, is my voice too loud? Sorry! Whenever I see young, promising warriors like you, my excitement just gets the better of me!<br>Ha ha! Hmm, I see you wondering, "Is this Grand Magister really on the level?" Don't worry -- I am! But I still love to chat with young warriors who are journeying through different territories.<br>Never fear, though -- I take my job seriously. <br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-2&reply=1">Listen to information about second class transfer.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-2&reply=5">Sub Class.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-3&reply=100">Clan.</a><br><a action="link al001.htm">Alliance.</a><br><a action="link reflect_weapon_master.htm">Use Shadow Weapon Exchange Coupon.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest.</a></body></html>
