<html><head><body>Employee of Magic Research Institute:<br>You'll help us? Excellent! Let me give you some instructions. Come see me <font color="LEVEL">every 12 hours</font> and I'll give you a scroll and a Cupid's Fatigue Recovery Potion, which you can use to call out the fatigued cows and revitalize them. Just so you know, the captain cows are very difficult -- you'll need some friends to help you. <font color="LEVEL">Also remember</font> that you must be careful not to lease the cow during the revitalization process, since the cows are very sensitive animals.<br>f you find the lost scrolls, you can also use them to revitalize the cows' energies. After you've done so, the cows will pay you in their currency, which is called Apiga. Bring that Apiga to me and I'll give you a reward. Oh, sometimes a bull or captain bull will give you Golden Apiga. Bring me that and I'll give you a special reward. One more thing: some very fatigued cows will need their energies revitalized very quickly. If you can do so within the required time frame, the Apigas you'll receive will be doubled.<br> <br><br> <a action="link event_cow_manager009.htm">Ask about Apigas.</a></body></html>
