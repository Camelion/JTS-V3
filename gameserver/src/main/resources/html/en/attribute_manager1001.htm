<html><head><body>Female Attribute Manager:<br>Welcome, adventurer!<br>We have observed that certain monsters have recently become stronger by magically infusing themselves with more powerful attribute capabilities. I trust that you have also been attempting to magically strengthen your own attributes in order to fight them. As it happens, while exploring the continent I acquired a special skill to handle magical attribute power. The power can't be completely controlled, but even my partial skill will prove useful!<br>Unfortunately, I cannot simply give you this secret potion; the ingredients are extremely difficult to obtain and I must have sufficient funds to support my disciples in their quest to find them!<br><a action="link attribute_manager_info001.htm">Ask about attributes.</a> <br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-303&reply=608">Buy an attribute-strengthening potion.</a> <br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-303&reply=619">Exchange one Attribute Ore for another.</a> <br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-550&reply=611">Remove attribute bestowed on weapon or armor.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
