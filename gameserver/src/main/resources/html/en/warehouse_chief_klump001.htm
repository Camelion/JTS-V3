Warehouse Chief Klump:<br>Pleased to meet you. I am Warehouse Chief Klump of the Iron Gate Guild.

Of course, here we focus more on decorative and artistic pieces rather than everyday items.<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-2&reply=1">Listen to information about second class transfer.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-2&reply=5">Sub Class.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-3&reply=100">Clan.</a><br><a action="link al001.htm">Alliance.</a><br><a action="link reflect_weapon_master.htm">Use Shadow Weapon Exchange Coupon.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest.</a></body></html>
