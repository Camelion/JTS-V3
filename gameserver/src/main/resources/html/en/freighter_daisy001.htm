Warehouse Keeper Daisy:<br>Hugin, Durin and Lunin... All three are my beloved siblings. It is very hard for a family to be posted at the same place even though we belong to the same guild...  It is all because of uncle Donar's patronage. <br>Family is precious. We all have to take good care of our family. If you have some time, why don't you give your family a gift? You can get it back from the family village after placing it in our storage.<br><center><a action="link storage_people.htm">Private Warehouse</a><br><a action="link storage_clan.htm">Clan Warehouse</a><br><a action="bypass -h learn_skill">Learn Skill</a><br><a action="link g_cube_warehouse001.htm"><font color="LEVEL">Wondrous Cubis</font></a><br><a action="link skillenchant_help.htm">Ask about skill enhancement</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></center></body></html>
