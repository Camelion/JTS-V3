was created by a gigantic meteorite... However, not many know that the meteorite 
was composed almost entirely of Nebulite, and is currently locked away in the 
basement of the tower! Those in the Ivory Tower want to keep all the Nebulite 
for themselves!<BR>Does this seem fair? Should the source of the most powerful 
magical power on earth be monopolized by a few privileged groups? I think not! 
That Nebulite should be used for the greater public good! Don't you agree?<BR><A
