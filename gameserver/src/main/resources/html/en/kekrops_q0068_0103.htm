<html><head><body>Hierarch Kekropus:<br>I see. When you finally unbind all the seals and reclaim the power, come find me. Then we will talk about the fate that lies before you. Until then, there is a total of 6 seals that you are under.  You can unbind them at the Tablet of Vision using the Resonance Amulet. I can tell you the location of the Resonance Amulet you will need to unbind the first seal. In anticipation of this situation, I prepared the Resonance Amulet beforehand and have entrusted it to Head Warehouse Keeper Mona in the Town of Goddard. Go there and say that I sent you and that you are to receive the amulet.<br> This is all I can tell you now; you must discover the rest for yourself. But know that unbinding the seal is not simply about power. It is about who is truly worthy to wield such power...  I will be waiting for you to unbind all the seals and return to me.<br> One final matter: I know you and your comrades have faced frequent attacks on this path. I can give you details about your attackers that will enable you to better withstand their assaults. </body></html>
