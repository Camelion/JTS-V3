<html><head><body>Bonny:<br>You can buy a Redemption Bow that already possesses all the skills needed to restore Grandfather's cursed crew for just 2,008 Adena. I feel a little awkward selling it to you, since you've agreed to help, but I have to cover my expenses. I'm sure you understand...<br><br>There are a couple things you should know. When you equip a Redemption Bow, you can use both the Pardon and Forgiveness skills. I'm confident that you'll find them very useful. I've discovered that Pardon works much better than Forgiveness, and you can use it once per minute. Are you ready to buy now?<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=2&reply=3">Buy Redemption Bow.</a><br><a action="link event_rat_manager001.htm">Quit</a><br></body></html>
