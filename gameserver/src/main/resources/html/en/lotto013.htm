<html><body> Lottery Ticket Seller:<br>Here is how to play the lottery: Select 
five numbers between 1 and 20. Your prize is determined by how many winning 
numbers you match. First place goes to those who pick all five winning numbers. 
First place prize amount is 60% of the total jackpot amount, minus the fourth 
place prize. Second place goes to those who pick four out of the five winning 
numbers. Second place prize amount is 20% of the total jackpot amount, minus the 
fourth place prize. Third place goes to those who pick three out of the five 
winning numbers. Third place prize amount is 20% of the total jackpot amount, 
minus the fourth place prize. Fourth place goes to those who pick two or less of 
the winning numbers. Fourth place prize amount is 200 Adena. It should be noted 
that the fourth place prize is given even to those who do not pick any winning 
numbers. The prize money for each category will be divided equally amongst 
winners. If there are no winners in any category, those winnings are transferred 
to the next jackpot. Lottery Tickets are sold on alternating days at 5 p.m. 
Results are announced the following day at 12:05 p.m. All times are subject to 
change. I wish you luck! Enjoy the lottery! <br>
