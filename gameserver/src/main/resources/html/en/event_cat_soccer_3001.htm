<body>Tony The Cat:<br>Welcome! My name's Tony, and I just love soccer! Meow!<br>I love all games, but the World Cup is my all-time favorite competition!<br>The roar of the crowd and the tension of a close game makes my heart beat so fast that I feel like I might faint! It's a great way to relieve stress!<br>Therefore, I've quit my job so I'll have more time to follow the games! I've started selling Boxes of Cheerleading Gear to help our team advance. Meow!<br>By the way, have you heard? Our mighty Taeguk Warriors have advanced to the Round of 8! Meow!<br>Now I should be able to sell a lot more boxes!<br>I've even reduced the price for the remainder of the World Cup period! Meow! I'm calling the event the <font color="LEVEL">Viva Victory Korea Event</font>!<br>If you have any questions, just ask me! Meow!<br><a action="link event_cat_soccer_3002.htm">"Tell me more about the event."</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-303&reply=554">"I'd like to buy a Box of Cheerleading Gear."</a></body></html>
