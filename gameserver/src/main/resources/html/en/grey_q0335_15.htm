Guild Member Grey:<br>You wish to leave the guild?  Certainly you know that is impossible.  Once you join this brotherhood you are in for life... Didn't you know that?... You should reconsider your decision...<br>... The fear in your eyes makes it impossible for me to keep a straight face! I'm joking, you idiot! Of course you can leave if that is what you really want... You must have a good reason... <br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=335&reply=3">Leave</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=335&reply=4">Cancel</a></body></html>
