<body>Duda-Mara Totem Spirit:<br> Take this stone  that the god of fire has entrusted with your tribe.  Two of Hubai's disciples stole it from him. Things did not go well as they left on their last training mission as Tyrants... <br> I'm afraid one of them killed Hubai, and the other is relentlessly pursuing the killer! <br> To find them, you must undertake the last training journey of a Tyrant.<br> First you must learn from the Tablet of Vision near the Tower of Insolence.  You should get going!  </body></html>
