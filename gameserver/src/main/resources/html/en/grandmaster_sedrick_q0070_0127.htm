<body>Grand Master Cedric:<br>This Resonance Amulet operates by a magic switch. An orc priest named Tarkai that I recently met told me how to recharge the magic power.
<br>A piece of stone was needed, of the kind that the Ketra Orcs or the Varka Silenos possess. It is a source of energy the holds the concentrated power that flows through the ground. They call it the <font color="LEVEL">Divine Stone of Wisdom</font> and they worship it.
<br>That stone is the only way to restore the Resonance Amulet's power. But since they do not show it to anybody, you must earn their trust before you can obtain the stone. Now, which side will you visit?<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=70&reply=6">Ketra Orc</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=70&reply=7">Varka Silenos</a></body></html>
