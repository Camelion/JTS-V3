Freight and Warehouse Keeper Balcon:<br>Welcome, youngster. You seem to be doing very well for yourself. Ever consider depositing some of your items instead of carrying them around like that man over there? He looks like a peddler! No, clearly we offer a better, safer alternative here at the Steel Gate Guild. <br>And once you deposit an item, you can withdraw it at any of our branches! For the sake of security, of course, only the people you designate can do so.<br><center><a action="link warehouse_keeper_balcon001c.htm"><font color="LEVEL">Use the freight service.</font></a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-303&reply=631">Purchase an item with a Cubic piece.</a><br><a action="bypass -h learn_skill">Learn skills.</a><br><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest.</a></center></body></html>
