<html><head><body> High Priest Hollint:<br>It's not something I can explain fully, but I often feel the presence of great spiritual beings. Just as you cannot explain to the color blind what red looks like, I cannot explain this sense of mine to you. But you have sharp eyes and a strong sense of faith, both of which are necessary tools for the task I am about to bestow upon you.<br>I want you to go to <font color="LEVEL">the Town of Goddard</font> and look for the <font color="LEVEL">Saint of Light</font>. Report back to me if you find them.<br>Franz has already started looking into the Saints, his findings have all been recorded in this book here. He also ran into a troublesome individual who seemed hellbent on stopping him, and while I sincerely hope you do not run into him, there is information in this book that will help you deal with him too.<br> Go, my child. May the divine blessings of Einhasad be with you always....</body></html>
