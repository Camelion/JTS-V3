<br>
The Blessed Spiritshot - D-Grade is used in conjunction with another D-Grade weapon.  It is a support-type magic item that greatly increases a weapon's M. Atk. Since it has the effect of increasing one's magic casting speed and many Mystics use the spiritshot to cast more powerful magic, the manufacture of a spiritshot will be of great benefit to Dwarves. The skill of a novice Artisan is necessary to create this item.
