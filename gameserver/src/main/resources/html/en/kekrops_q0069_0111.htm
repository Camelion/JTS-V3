Therefore the full extent of our power remained sealed, even from us. <br>But the woman in the blue dress fashioned it so that a skilled Kamael who proved worthy of that power would be able to unlock the seal and wield the full range of our abilities<br>It is not an easy process, however... <br><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=69&reply=1">"So there's a hidden power that can make us stronger... how do I acquire it?"</a></body></html>
