<body>Duda-Mara Totem Spirit:
<br>You young fool...! Even if I am here to help you, how could you come before a spirit without bringing a proper sacrifice...?! Couldn't you have brought at least some <font color="LEVEL">Bitter Cold Vodka</font>?
<br>Be grateful that I didn't devour you outright for this!</body></html>
