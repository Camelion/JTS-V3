The Spellhowler has the powerful magical attack of a Sorcerer and the Black Magic powers of a Necromancer. They can exterminate an enemy with a single blow but lack stamina and occasionally need help from others, although their use of Black Magic is helpful when they must fight alone.  <br>To be a Spellhowler, your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Scholar, the Mark of Fate, and the Mark of the Magus.<br><a action="link master_lv3_de007wat.htm">Ask about marks.</a><br><a action="link master_lv3_de006wa.htm">Return</a></body></html>
