<body>Singsing:<br>On this Primeval Island you'll find ancient creatures called dinosaurs -- you'll never see anything like them in Aden, believe me! According to wise wizards, even the gods and Giants were afraid of the dinosaurs. They cannot be found in Aden -- thankfully -- but are still plentiful in that strange island.<br>Around the wharf, you'll find only relatively weak ones, but they are still a challenge for even the hardiest adventurer. <br>The wizard Philberg has been pestering me to acquire some of those creatures' bone for study. If you defeat them and bring back their bones, I will purchase them from you on his behalf. What do you say?<br><a action="bypass -h quest_accept?quest_id=<?quest_id?>">"Doesn't sound that tough -- count me it."</a><br><a action = "link singsing_q0643_03.htm">"Ah, I really can't stand reptiles... Sorry, but I'll pass."</a>  </body></html>
