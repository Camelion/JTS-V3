<html><body><br>Paparapiyah~~ It's been a while everybody.<br>I am Lineage 2 World's <font color="LEVEL">Master Dugi</font>.<br>For the Ghost Festival, in order to comfort monster's spirits in Lineage 2 World, I have come to request help from you. Let me briefly explain what I'll be asking from you today.<br><font color="LEVEL"> First of all, take the Magic Box to obtain Soul Silver Foil and Soul Scent. You can't take any more in the inventory.<br>Next, use the Soul Silver Foil or Soul Scent on a dead monster to comfort its soul.</font><br>As you know, now is the time when the souls of dead monsters are especially generous. I hope you all become wonderful adventurers who do great things in the Lineage 2 world. So I got Master Dugi to personnally create the Silver Foil and Scent. Then, everyone do your help~~ Paparapiyah!<br><br><a action="link br_ghostmonth_manager002.htm">I'm curious about the event rewards.</a><br><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=50002&reply=1">Receive the Soul Magic Box.</a><br></body></html>
