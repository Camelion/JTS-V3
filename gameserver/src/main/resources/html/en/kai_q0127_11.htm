Take it to <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Chief Alder in the Town of Schuttgart</font> and he will give you his report, as well as the mark you will require to obtain the next collaborator's report. When you have collected a report from each collaborator, deliver the information to Dominic.<br>By the way, the quickest way to reach Alder in Schuttgart is to pass through Rune Township. May Gran Kain smile on your journey! </body></html>
