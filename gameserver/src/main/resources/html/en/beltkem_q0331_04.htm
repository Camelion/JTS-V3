Did you not promise to bring me harpy's <font color="LEVEL">Silver Feathers, the teeth of a Wyrm</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">venom of a medusa</font>?  <br>As soon as you obtain these three materials, bring them to me.  I will reward you for each that you bring back.  I've inherited quite a fortune from my deceased parents, so don't worry about the reward.  Please don't quit, help me.<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=331&reply=1">Say you will quit</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=331&reply=2"> Say you will collect the materials</a></body></html>
