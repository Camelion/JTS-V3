[Create Blessed Spiritshot – A-Grade]
</center>
<br>
The Blessed Spiritshot - A-Grade is used in conjunction with other A-Grade weapons. It is a support-type magic item that greatly increases a weapon's M. Atk. Since it has the effect of increasing one's magic casting speed and many high level Mystics use it to cast more powerful magic, the manufacturing of spiritshot can be profitable for Dwarves. Item creation requires the skill of a master Warsmith.
