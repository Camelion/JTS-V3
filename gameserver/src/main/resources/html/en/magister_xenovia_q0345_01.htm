<html><head><body>Magister Xenovia:<BR>I'm afraid I can't tell you much about that Medium Jar, not that you are the first to inquire about it... Some fellow from the Dark 
Elven village was asking questions about it a while back. <BR>I'm of the opinion 
that the urn's abilities have been vastly over-stated in these wild rumors. I 
don't believe that actual souls of the dead can be conjured with it. At most it 
is a simple conduit between this world and the abyss where Shilen dwells. Hmm, 
that isn't far from the rumors, is it? Heh heh...<BR>Oh, yes, I forgot. Some 
powder was delivered here recently that is supposed to be used with the urn. 
Something about putting it into the urn along with an article belonging to a 
dead person...<BR><A action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=345&reply=1">"I wish
