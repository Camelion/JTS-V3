<body>Grand Seer Rahorakti:
<br>Tarkai Zu Duda-Mara! Wandering Warcryer and Spiderweb Priest! He always travels on spiderwebs, leaving a spiderweb trail wherever he goes!
<br>He came to me a while ago and spoke about the ways to prepare for winter!
<br>If my eyes do not fail me, according to Tarkai, you are the one who will knit the sweaters needed to survive the winter! Take ths book that Tarkai gave me! Walk along the path of a righteous Warcryer!
<br>Follow the path that Tarkai walked! Leave for the road that he spoke about! Duda-Mara, Tarkai's spirit, will know that path! Go and ask the Duda-Mara Totem Spirit!<br></body></html>
