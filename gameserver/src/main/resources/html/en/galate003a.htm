<html><head><body>Galate:<br>We have a problem. This equipment requires an energy source, but I cannot leave here at the moment to obtain it. It is a crystal that never loses its light, even in the dark. It is extremely rare -- we only keep a small sample in the Ivory Tower. But I have heard that a fisherman near Isle of Prayer has found a significant amount of the mineral in question. Please go to him and obtain it. <br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1006&reply=2">Give her the crystals.</a></body></html>
