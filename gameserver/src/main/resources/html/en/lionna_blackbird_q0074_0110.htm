<body>Leona Blackbird:
<br>I had my suspicions for a while. Why did the fire dragon come to see me that time? How did Antharas awaken? The fact that the Seal of Shilen awoke is a particularly important piece of evidence.
<br>The age of chaos... The age that the fire dragon spoke of has arrived. During this age of chaos and violence, the most important thing is the power to carry out your own will...
<br>And the demons. They were all speaking to me. Valakas hasn't said anything to me, but I know. He wants to say that I must gain an overwhelming amount of power in order to find the peace that I seek.
<br>It is the same for you. A warlord is a warrior who fights alone against many enemies. The stronger you become, the fewer deaths our allies suffer. Even if the deaths that I cause drag me to the depths of hell, I must become someone who gives birth to death.
<br>So that no one can challenge me...
<br>Now, take this. The last Stone of Commune... This will help you find a new understanding. After the final commune, go find Master Aiken in Aden Castle Town.
