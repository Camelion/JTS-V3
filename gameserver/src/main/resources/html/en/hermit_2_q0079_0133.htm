<body>Hermit:<br>Now I shall teach you about the second test. The Archon of Halisha has the fifth Resonance Amulet. You must capture him in order to obtain the fifth Stone.
<br>After doing so, you can commune with the Tablet of Vision that is northwest of the Wall of Argos.
<br>Now I will tell you how to capture the Archon of Halisha.
<br>He is often at the Imperial Tomb. Capture his followers on the northern side of the Wall of Argos, and he might come out.
<br>My wait for the successor may yet be over. Go carefully, and good luck be with you.</body></html>
