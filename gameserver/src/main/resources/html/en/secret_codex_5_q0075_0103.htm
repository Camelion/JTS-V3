<body>Tablet of Vision:<br>An incomprehensible knowledge digs into your head. You think you see a man wearing black armor...
<br>Then, you sense it. An enormous machine that continues its ancient orders to protect...
<br>It was commanded to protect the giants by blocking the Orcs on their mad rush for power. It defeated Muhark and made itself the guardian.
<br>And the Hestui exiles raised their weapons and are trying to fight against it. It is located on the Forsaken Plains, in the distant giant lands to the south. There stands the ancient tablet!</body></html>
