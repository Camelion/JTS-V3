Greetings, my lord! Do you wish to hire mercenaries?<br>
Currently, due to the influence of the seal of strife, I regret to say that it has become difficult to mobilize our guild members.<br>
You can still hire <font color="LEVEL">Deadmen of War</font>. Although you possess a posting ticket from a previous Contract, if it does not meet the conditions of the seal, you won't be able to place it.<br>
Although the situation appears dire, trust in your soldiers and be brave until the end.
<br>
If you wish to know the method of Contract, just ask me.
