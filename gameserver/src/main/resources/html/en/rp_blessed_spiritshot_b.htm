[Create Blessed Spiritshot – B-Grade]
</center>
<br>
The Blessed Spiritshot - B-Grade is used in conjunction with other B-Grade weapons. It is a support-type magic item that greatly increases a weapon's M. Atk. Since it has the effect of increasing one's magic casting speed, and many high-level Mystics use the spiritshot to cast powerful magic, the manufacture of spiritshot can be profitable for Dwarves. An experienced Warsmith should be able to create this item.
