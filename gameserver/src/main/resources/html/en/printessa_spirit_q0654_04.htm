Can you go to <font color="LEVEL">Argos' wall</font> and defeat either <font color="LEVEL">Canyon Antelope</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Canyon Antelope Slave</font>, and bring <font color="LEVEL">Antelope Hide</font>? A well polished hide is as good as parchment.<br>Ah! For your information, <font color="LEVEL">everybody in the group would need a scroll to pass the Force Field.</font> So everybody needs an Antelope Hide.</body></html>
