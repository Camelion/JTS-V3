<body>Tablet of Vision:<BR>The Tablet of Vision begins to be wrapped up in 
brightness. Thunderous chanting clogs your mind and yet gives you understand of something.... something that cannot be understood! You hear a familiar woman's voice whispering again. The location of the next Resonance Amulet is gradually becoming clear...The Shrine in the Town of Goddard...There 
is Grand Magister Fairen...<BR>Grand Magister Fairen has the Resonance Amulet! 
The vision disappears slowly, and there is the Tablet of Vision, no longer 
emitting light.</BODY></HTML>
