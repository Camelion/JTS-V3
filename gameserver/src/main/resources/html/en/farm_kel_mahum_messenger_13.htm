Kookaburras are quite rare. They possess unusually long legs and brilliantly-colored feathers... They peck the enemy with their beaks and use a mysterious and extremely powerful magic. They don't respond well to beatings. The only reason I was able to capture them is their susceptibility to magic.<br> <a action="link farm_kel_mahum_messenger_6.htm">"I want to choose another NPC."</a><br> <a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=1&reply=6">"I want to form an alliance."</a>
