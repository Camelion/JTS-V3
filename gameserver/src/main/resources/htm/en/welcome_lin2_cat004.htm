<body>Strategist Lucien:<br>Did you bring your orders? Good! Then in exchange for them I'll trade you a Shadow Weapon or other supplies suitable for your level.<br>What's a Shadow Weapon, you ask? You must have been away for a while!  A regular object is magically transformed for a while into an effective weapon or piece of armor.<br>Its magical power will decrease once it's been equipped.  Once this power has been consumed, the weapon will disappear. <br>But until then, you will have the time you need to equip different armor and weapons.<br>Plan carefully!<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-601&reply=2">Shadow Weapon: Receive a weapon.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-601&reply=3">Shadow Armor: Receive armor.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-601&reply=4">Receive supplies.</a></body></html>
