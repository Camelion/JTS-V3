<body>Kain Van Halter:<br>I see. Well, I guess you're also participating in that duelist pilgrimage, or whatever it is.
<br>Honestly, the so-called truth written on the Tablet wasn't really anything big. Just use all your strength every time you fight. Treat every blow as if it's your last... Wasn't that the gist of it?
<br>That's nothing exceptional. But then again, it's true that the right attitude can lead to unbelievable and miraculous works...
<br>So it looks like I have to leave on another journey. Oh, here's the last Resonance Amulet. I don't need it anymore, so you can use it. Happy trails, mate.
