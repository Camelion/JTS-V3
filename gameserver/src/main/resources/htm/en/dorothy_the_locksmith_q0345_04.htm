<html><head><body>Locksmith Dorothy:<br>So...what I'm saying is we should catch those accursed Crokians, open up their bellies and see what's inside. Even if we don't find the treasure, we'll have ruled out one possibility. You understand?<br>Now then, go hunt <font color="LEVEL">Crokians and Crokian Warriors</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Alligator Beach</font> outside the village. Once you slay them, bring me what's inside -- even if it's just the remains of my friends. Meanwhile, I'll see what else I can find out. If I get to the treasure first, I promise I'll cut you in for a share. Deal?</body></html>
