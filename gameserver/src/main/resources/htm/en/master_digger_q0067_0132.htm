<html><head><body>Master Digler: <br>You can obtain the amulet by defeating <font color="LEVEL">Halisha </font>, who is located within <font color="LEVEL">the four great cemeteries</font>. You must form a party to enter. <br>If that proves too difficult, defeat the followers of Halisha at the <font color="LEVEL">Memorials of the Lords</font>. By doing so, you can earn "tickets." Once you have acquired over <font color="LEVEL">700</font><br> tickets, Halisha himself will appear. By the way, the creatures you must face are the <font color="LEVEL">Grave Scarab, Scavenger Scarab, Grave Ant, Scavenger Ant, Shrine Knight and Stander.</font></body></html>
