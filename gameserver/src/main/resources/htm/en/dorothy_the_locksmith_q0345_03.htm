Using this information, my friends were able to steal some of Zaken's treaure from Devil's Isle. But before they reached me they were all eaten by Crokians on Alligator Beach. I searched up and down, but I couldn't find track or trace of any treasure. Either it was taken somewhere or it's inside the bellies of the Crokians.<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=345&reply=1">"So?"</a></body></html>
