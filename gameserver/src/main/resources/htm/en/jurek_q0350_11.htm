<html><head><body>Grand Magister Jurek: <br>Please use the soul crystal to collect the souls of the monsters. The monsters whose souls you must collect are located in <font color="LEVEL">Northern Oren, the Forest of Mirrors, Giant's Cave, the Devastated Castle, the Tower of Insolence upper level, Watcher's Tomb, the Garden of Eva, and Devil's Isle</font>. If you take the soul-filled soul crystal and a weapon to the blacksmith, he will give your weapon a special ability. <br>During these times, it is more important than ever to raise your own strength. If you combine everyone's advancing power, I believe that you will be able to stand against the oncoming threat. I hope that next time we meet, you will be even stronger... <br><a action="link jurek_q0350_12.htm">"Tell me more about the monsters."</a></body></html>
