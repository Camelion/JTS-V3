But now a few Human merchants have bribed some high-ranking officials to be allowed to take over the trade routes to Innadril, Abella and Giran.

But there are too many monsters ther right now.<br>Interested in getting rid of them for us? You'll be well paid for your efforts...<br><a action="bypass -h quest_accept?quest_id=<?quest_id?>">Say yes.</a></body></html>
