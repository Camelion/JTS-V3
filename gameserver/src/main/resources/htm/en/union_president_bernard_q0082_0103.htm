<html><head><body>Hunters Guild President Bernard: <br>Oh! Thank you, thank you, my friend! <br>If you can recover the bow and preserve my good name, then I'll certainly repay the favor. <br>One hand washes the other, eh? Heh! I feel more relieved already! <br>You should know that the thief who stole the bow is highly skilled indeed. While I was momentarily . . . uh, delayed, he somehow managed to penetrate our guild's precautions and make off with the bow.  Incredible! <br>As you begin your investigation, I think you should begin by talking to Information Broker Grimst here in the village. Perhaps he knows something about this incident that may be useful to you. <br>Oh! In my haste, I almost forgot to tell you that this book was found on the floor near where the bow was stolen. <br>I've told you everything I know. Good luck; our guild is counting on you! </body></html>
