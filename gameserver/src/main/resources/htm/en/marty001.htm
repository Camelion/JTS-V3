Warehouse Freightman Marty:<br>If you have an item that's too heavy to carry but too valuable to leave just anywhere, consider using our warehouse! Our dwarven businessmen own just about all the warehouses and banking businesses in the entire continent. Aside from that, when you store your item with us, you can retrieve it anywhere! <br>What do you think? We even have a branch inside the Ivory Tower that the royal family cannot touch. Isn't it amazing?<br><br><center><a action="link storage_people.htm">Private warehouse</a><br><a action="link storage_clan.htm">Clan warehouse</a><br><a action="bypass -h learn_skill">Learn skill</a><br><a action="link g_cube_warehouse001.htm"><font color="LEVEL">Wondrous Cubic</font></a><br><a action="link welcomeback001.htm">Dormant account support</a><br><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></center></body></html>
