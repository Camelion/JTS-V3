They built a mighty empire, developing their science to a level that the world had never seen.  <br>To protect themselves from the gods, they also began to develop weapons capable of harming the gods themselves.<br>They used what they had discovered during the war of the gods to unlock the secrets of life itself.<br>We, the Kamael, are the result of the Giants' experiments to create life independent of the gods and their wheel of fate. <br>Although we have not the raw power of the Giants, much less the gods, because we were created outside of the natural order we, more than any other creatures, are able to oppose the gods. <br>Just as even the mightiest beast can be felled by a drop of deadly poison, so we were created to be a poisoned dagger to fell the gods themselves...<br><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=69&reply=13">Continue listening. </a></body></html>
