<html><head><body>Employee of Magic Research Institute:<br>We have prepared <font color="LEVEL">fresh milk</font> from the cows, a new <font color="LEVEL">hair accessory</font>, a <font color="LEVEL">Crystal Cube</font>, various <font color="LEVEL">buff potions</font>, a <font color="LEVEL">Blessed Scroll of Escape</font> and a <font color="LEVEL">Blessed Scroll of Resurrection</font> for adventurers who help us. As a reward for bringing us Golden Apigas, we will also give you <font color="LEVEL">Energy Replenishing Herb Tea</font> which restores your vitality.<br>For your information, the Crytal Cube is very unstable and easily breakable once opened. Apparently the Energy Replenishing Herb Tea <font color="LEVEL">is ineffective if used along with the Creation Day gift buff</font>, so please be careful.</body></html>
