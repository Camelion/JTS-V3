<html><head><body>Bonny:<br>The greed of some people amazes me! If they had just left well enough alone, none of this would have happened. Ah, but what's done is done... My grandfather's sense of humor is as ruthless as he is -- he's transformed those thieving bilge rats into a crew of actual mice! Although they're mostly harmless, they've still managed to cause a great deal of chaos, and I'm sure we're in for a cheese shortage of epic proportions unless we act quickly!<br><br>Will you help me lift the curse from these poor fools? Right now they're scattered...uh, scampering...all over town. Eek, there's one now! Shoot each of them with a Redemption Bow, using the skills Forgiveness and Pardon, and you will remove the curse. No other weapons, not even other bows, will work. Of course, first you'll need a Redemption Bow -- which I just happen to have for sale.<br><br>In return for your help, I'll reward you by exchanging the Mouse Coins you collect for other items that Grandpa Zaken doesn't really need anymore:  Enchant Weapon Scrolls, High-Grade Life Stones, Wondrous Cubics, circlets and many other presents! In fact, if you take Wondrous Cubic pieces to a Warehouse Freightman, you'll be able to purchase all kinds of Enchantment Scrolls! Pretty handy, huh?<br><br>I suppose that I should mention that sometimes -- very infrequently, I assure you -- a group of cursed deckhands will rally together and transform into a Cursed Buccaneer. If you encounter one, don't try to defeat him alone! There are also a very few Cursed Lookouts who will provide you with many more Mouse Coins than the other cursed mice. One more thing! Rumor has it that the monsters in the area have taken a fancy to the Mouse Coins, too. If you're really lucky, you might even find Mouse Coins while hunting. Well, good luck! <br><a action="link event_rat_manager001.htm">Back</a></body></html>
