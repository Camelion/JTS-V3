<body>Grand Master Cedric:<br>First, head to Goddard and find Felix there. He was once a knight of Dion, and he fell in love with a woman from a certain village.
<br>When the peasant rebellion and the knights were sent to suppress it, he abandoned his post and ran away to protect her.
<br>Also, this record of one of the greatest knights has been passed down through our Knight Guild. But because he became obsessed with his own glory, he eventually disappeared in the end...
<br>Felix may be similar to him in many ways. Perhaps is it true for all of us who are called knights...</body></html>
