Grand Magister Celes:<br>It's rather simple, really. Once one reaches a certain level of ability and experience, that person transfers to the next class level.

If you'd like, I can explain either of these occupations to you.<br><a action="link grandmagister_celes006ha.htm">Wizard</a><br><a action="link grandmagister_celes006hb.htm">Cleric</a></body></html>
