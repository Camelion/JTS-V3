<body>Miki the Cat: <br>Mee-yow! Hi there, Mr. Traveler. So what brings you to such a purrr-fectly remote place? Say, if you happen to have a map of this area, how about selling it to me? <br> Without a map, it's easy to get all turned around out here. You'd best watch your step as well, especially if you're headed for even more remote areas! <br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
