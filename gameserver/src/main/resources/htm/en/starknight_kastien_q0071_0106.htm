<body>Starlight Knight Kastien:
<br>It's finally come down...
<br>Those chains that were wrapped around my elder brother's body... The evil spirit that our race raised and fostered... Thank you, brother. Without your help, it would have been difficult for us to bring it down.
<br>Its true character is the wall that we Elves have raised. After being betrayed by other races, our hearts rejected associating with anyone other than Elvish kind. Betrayed and wounded, we raised this wall to protect our fragile pride and to end our ties with the world...
<br>But our Elven race was not always this way. This is a story that you also know. The story about that pride, that we Elves must keep.
