White Lady:<br>Hello! I'm Shining White.<br>I'm giving out this beautiful bracelet to celebrate 2010, the year of tiger. It is a luxurious sparkling silver bracelet with 3 socket holes! <br>I wish I could give this to all of you for free, but seeing as I'm not too well off, I will have to charge you for the materials. I swear there's no profit for me. Really!<br>Oh, and I won't give it to someone who already has it. You could throw away your current bracelet and get another one, but I can't imagine why someone would do that.<br>
