Blacksmith Pinter:<br>Welcome! What can I do for you this fine day? Go ahead, ask me anything. I'm a 3rd-generation blacksmith and a proud Dwarf. In fact,  I'll wager my shop that you won't find another Dwarf in these parts with a fuller beard! Ha! I will tell you in all humility, though, that I am a master of my profession. I'm sure there is nothing beyond my skills.<br><a action="link dual_sword001.htm">Craft Dualsword.</a><br><a action="link blacksmith_recipe.htm">Make item.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-303&reply=205">Break the seal on B-Grade gloves and boots.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-303&reply=213">Reseal the unsealed B-Grade gloves and boots.</a><br><a action="link smelting_start.htm">Augment item.</a><br><a action="link smelting_break.htm">Cancel item augmentation.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=501&reply=1">Purchase Academy equipment.</a><br><a action="bypass -h learn_skill">Learn skills.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">View information about the local lord and tax rate.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest.</a></body></html>
