<body>Leona Blackbird:
<br>Hmm. Looks like you won after all.
<br>Good. Welcome. I am Leona Blackbird. Some people call me the fire dragon's bride, but Valakas and I never wed.
<br>The only thing I have is experience as Giran's defense general. It is true that the fire dragon spoke to me about this pilgrimage. It's also true that I didn't listen. I never imagined that Sieghardt Ein would attack with such timing.
<br>But now that I think about it, I understand. That is why I also hoped that someone like you would come after me.
