Well obviously, it's not physical ability!<br>Since your tribe began its dealing with Humans, your cultural heritage has been all but lost! We may share the same ancestral relics from the ancestors, but they mean different things to our tribes!<br>Although our tribe's blood line is clearly superior to your tribe's, not to mention the fact that we outnumber you, the genuine successor to the Orc throne must come from your Flame tribe! Take this stone, and contemplate the reason I've given it to you!<br>The pilgrimage of the king is a pilgrimage of forgotten Orcs. I'm not sure how this tradition has been changed by your tribe... This is all the help I know how to give. Take this stone and go to the south side of the Tower of Insolence!</body></html>
