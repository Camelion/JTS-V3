<html><head><body>Magister Hanellin:<BR>The three sacred relics are contained in three 
separate arks and hidden in Aden, Giran and somewhere in the Dark Elven Forest 
across the Misty Mountains.<BR>We Dark Elves have a great natural interest in 
the Tower of Insolence and Baium.<BR>Please go and meet with <font 
color="LEVEL">Madam Claudia Athebaldt</font> in this village. She has been 
searching in this area for the ark for quite a while. I believe she has made 
some progress. I am fairly sure that she can be found strolling in the flower 
garden near Aden Castle... If you show her this letter, she will tell you where 
the ark is. </BODY></HTML>
