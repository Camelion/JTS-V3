<html><head><body>Attribute Master Yin:<br>I appreciate your help. Unfortunately, it won't be easy. You must recapture the <font color="LEVEL">Reckless Sprites of Water</font> using this device.<br>They are still precious experimental subjects, remember. If they are killed, all our work will have been in vain.<br>This device changes the materialized energy of the Sprites to <font color="LEVEL">Reckless Sprite Piece - Water</font>. Collect at least <font color="LEVEL">6</font> of them. That should be enough to allow me to continue my research.<br>One more thing: the device's power is limited, and it will disappear after <font color="LEVEL">10 minutes</font>. Please act quickly!</body></html>
