<html><head><body>Bonny:<br>Greetings Adventurer!<br>I am the granddaughter of the great pirate Zaken.  Throughout the years, many people have taken pieces of my grandfather's treasure from his hideout.  He is not a forgiving man, and has cursed anyone who has stolen from him.  I feel bad for these people because they will be trapped forever unless something is done.<br><a action="link event_pig_manager002.htm">How can I help?</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=1&reply=3">Buy Redemption Bow.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=3&reply=2">Get your reward.</a></body></html>
