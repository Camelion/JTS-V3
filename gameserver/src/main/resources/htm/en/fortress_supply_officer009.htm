<html><body>I am checking the supply warehouse.<br><br> The current supply level is <font color="LEVEL">Lv <?treasure_level?></font>. You can receive offers for supplies from the main castle once an alliance is in place, which can be confirmed through the supply level.<br> Each level is increased every 6 hours while an alliance is in effect, and it can go up by 6 levels. However, please remember that you must offer a tribute of 25,000 Adena before receiving the supplies.<br> <br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-271&reply=1">Receive supplies.</a>
