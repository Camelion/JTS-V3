<html><body> Have you heard of Sir Gustav Von Vanerheim? His malevolent spirit 
rules this accursed castle. If you and your party intend to take over this 
place, you must first defeat its headless Lord. <br>His former aides, Mikhail 
and Dietrich, have joined him in death. The defeat of these beasts must be accomplished 
in order to restore peace to the castle.<br> 
But I must warn you, his destruction will not forestall his return! You fools! <br> <a action="Link
