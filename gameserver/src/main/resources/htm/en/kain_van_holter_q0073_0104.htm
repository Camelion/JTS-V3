<br>Your skills aren't bad! Isn't it a good thing that you can fight against such a strong opponent?
<br>Now, draw your weapon, and let's strike him together! You're not interested in eternal life or anything like that, right? Hah!
<br>A true battle only exists when there is real danger! If you fail and fall down, that's just the fate meant for you!</body></html>
