Also, your gourd will always wants to run away, so make sure you smash it before it is gone! Immature young watermelons run away after 3 minutes; and grown-up watermelons after 1 minute and 30 seconds! Also, you can't smash Honey Watermelons with an ordinary weapon! You can only hit it with the weapon named Crono something, which makes a musical sound when used, meow! Also, it is very hard to smash Honey Watermelons by yourself, so make sure you bring your friends to help you out! Lastly, when you smash the watermelon, you must do it on a flat land! It would be a bad idea to smash them near a roof or cliff, meow! <br>Finally, there are genetically cloned seeds, or cloned honey watermelon seeds, meow. My master has planted them on monsters to experiment, but hasn't collected them yet! The cloned seeds have the same functions as the original ones, but can only be used by whoever collects them.<br>Do you understand, meow?<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-303&reply=709">Exchange nectar</a></body></html>
