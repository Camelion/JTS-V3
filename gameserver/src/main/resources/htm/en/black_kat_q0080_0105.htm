<body>Black Cat:<br>I always sought to the challenges that ordinary people could never conceive. I then found information about the Forbidden Power of the gods that our guild's past heroes had challenged.
<br>And I challenged that power. But it ended in failure...
<br>My body was broken, such that my one chance to challenge that power was lost, and members within the guild who despised me pushed me out...
<br>Those were my worst days.
<br>But then I thought: Why does it have to be me? If someone I train obtains that power, I would share in their glory. So I used my brain instead of brawn to reach the guild's leadership after a long struggle.
<br>The hero that I imagined did not appear while I occupied that position. So I resigned with the promise from the succeeding guild president that I would receive potential candidates every week.
<br>Coin collecting is all he really cares about these days, but he looked like he had promise back then... Ah, well.
<br>So now, are you ready to challenge yourself? I'm your last warning, in the flesh. Win and achieve glories, or fail and end up a wreck, like me.
