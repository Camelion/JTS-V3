Since the island was opened to outsiders, I haven't had a moment to call my own! But the soldiers' seasonal supply date is almost here, and I need the Supply Manifest to check each store's preparation status. There's no way I'll be able to collect them all in time. Will you help me?<br><a action="bypass -h quest_accept?quest_id=<?quest_id?>">Say that you will help.</a> </body></html>
