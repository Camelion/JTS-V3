<html><head><body>Hierarch Kekropus:<br>The Giants who created us are long gone, and we are beings with free will. <br>Once the Isle of Souls was unsealed, my obligation to our former masters ended. The only thing I still feel compelled to do is share the truth with you... <br>Our future as a race will depend on the strength and wisdom of those like yourself.<br>You already know of our fighting skills, but that is not all that separates us from the other races. <br>We are unique in that we are not bound by the same gods-decreed fate that binds the other races.<br> You now know the truth about our race. One day, perhaps you will have the opportunity to obtain the power of the Trickster to use for the benefit of both the Kamael and the world itself.<br>(Only characters level 76 or higher may change occupations. Do not abandon the quest or you will not reach that goal!)<br></body></html>
