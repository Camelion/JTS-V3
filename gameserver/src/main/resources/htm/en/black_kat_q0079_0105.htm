<body>Black Cat:<br>When I was a member of the Hunter Guild, I challenged the forbidden power of the gods that surpassed the power of ordinary humans. And I failed...
<br>My broken body couldn't challenge that power again, and members within the guild who envied me pushed me out...
<br>I was disappointed and discouraged.
<br>But then I thought: If I can't do it myself, I can still train someone to get that power in my stead. So I used my brain instead of brawn to reach the guild's highest position after a long struggle. The person that I wanted did not appear while I occupied that position. So I resigned with the promise from the succeeding guild president that I would receive potential candidates every week.
<br>He's obsessed with coin collecting now, but he looked like he had promise back then... Sigh.
<br>Well, are you ready to challenge yourself? I'm asking if you're prepared to challenge that power. Broken as I am and ambitious as I was, I was never given such a choice from a wiser elder.
