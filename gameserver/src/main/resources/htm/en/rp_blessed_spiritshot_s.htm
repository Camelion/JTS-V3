[Create Blessed Spiritshot – S Grade]
</center>
<br>
Blessed Spiritshot - S Grade is used in conjunction with other S Grade weapons. It is a support magic item that greatly increases a weapon's M. Atk. Since it has the effect of increasing one's magic casting speed and many high level Mystics use it to cast more powerful magic, the manufacturing of spiritshot can be profitable for Dwarves. Only a grand master Warsmith has the skill necessary to create this item.
