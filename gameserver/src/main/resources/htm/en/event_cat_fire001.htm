<html><head><body>Buzz the Cat:<br>Greetings! Nice to meet you! I am Buzz the Cat, apprentice to Grand Astronomer Lunaris.<br>She has dedicated her life to the study of Aden's celestial bodies. Every summer, meteor showers illuminate the twilight sky as the falling stars descend to Aden.<br>Inspired by these natural light shows, Lady Lunaris began gathering and experimenting with the fallen star shards - the results were dazzling!<br>When combined with the right elements, the star shards shoot high into the heavens and burst into an explosion of brightly colored light.  It's quite a sight to see, especially at night! What better way to celebrate summer than a display of lights for all to share?<br><a action="link event_cat_fire002.htm">"Tell me about the event."</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=995&reply=1">"I want to create a Firework."</a></body></html>
