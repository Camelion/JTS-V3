<body>Black Cat:<br>At last, someone useful. When I failed in the past, I asked many people to help me make the challenge again. One of them, the Spellbook Seller Elena, agreed to research the records of those who had challenged the power long ago. Go check with her to see if she's found anything.
<br>Er, wait ...
<br>Elena and I aren't on the best terms right now, so you might have to cajole her a little.
<br>Also, this is what I've written down about the monster that crippled me, so it will be helpful for you to read.
<br>Off with you! And don't come back until the power is yours to hold!</body></html>
