<body>Chef Donath:<br> First, I'll need an <font color="LEVEL">Ice Crystal</font> and a <font color="LEVEL">fat white fish</font>.  The dish's name is deceptive. It's actually a lovely cold dish made of fish.  As Ice Crystals are the <font color="LEVEL">legendary food material, Chef Jeremy can tell you more of the details</font>.<br> You can either get the fish from a fisherman or catch it yourself! </body></html>
