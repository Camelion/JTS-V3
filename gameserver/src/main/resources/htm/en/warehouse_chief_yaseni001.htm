Warehouse Chief Yasheni:<br>Welcome, friend! Ah, I consider anyone who's been to my store even once a friend. That's how it should be, eh?<br>Don't worry about that item. I will take excellent care for it for you. Even in the unlikely event that a thief should penetrate the inmost recesses of our warehouse, he will never lay a hand on it, of that you can rest assured! I, the Dwarf Yasheni, swear it on my father's beard! <br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-2&reply=1">Listen to information about second class transfer.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-2&reply=5">Sub Class.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-3&reply=100">Clan.</a><br><a action="link al001.htm">Alliance.</a><br><a action="link reflect_weapon_master.htm">Use Shadow Weapon Exchange Coupon.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest.</a></body></html>
