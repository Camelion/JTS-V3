Grand Master Ferdinand:<br> Hello, my friend! Isn't this place wonderful? Ah, when I was young I had no time for the beauties of nature, but now that I am old I find Innadril's scenery positively intoxicating. I feel like a young boy on a picnic! Oh dear...please forgive my babbling. How can I help you?
