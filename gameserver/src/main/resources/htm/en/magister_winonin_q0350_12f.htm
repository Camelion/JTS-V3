<html><head><body>Magister Winonin: <br>Thus far, we have heard that the monsters suitable for obtaining souls at the Watcher's Tomb are the <font color="LEVEL">Malruk Knights, Malruk Berserkers, Malruk Lords, Limal Karinnesses, Kariks, Pytan Knights, and Pytans</font>. <br>Be warned, you cannot keep absorbing souls from monsters that are not very strong. If you only collect the souls of weak monsters, the soul crystal will begin to deny them. Once the soul crystal reaches a certain stage, it will desire souls from stronger monsters. If you think that you are no longer collecting the souls, you should try looking for stronger monsters. </body></html>
