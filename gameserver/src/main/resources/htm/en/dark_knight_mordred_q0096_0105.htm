<html><head><body> Mordred, The Dark Knight:<br>No, that's not it. I called you because I want to conduct an investigation into an ancient document. <font color="LEVEL">Elena, a Spellbook Seller in the Town of Goddard</font>, is very fluent in ancient languages. I've asked her to decipher the ancient document. Go to her and find out what she's discovered... If what they say about the forbidden power is true, we should reclaim it, don't you think?
<br>Will you do it?
