Magister Ladd:<br>You're as foolish as you look! Let me say it again as plainly as I can. Wizards can only learn magic from magisters of the same race. Elves and Humans are downstairs. Dwarves, Orcs and other warriors...well, I don't concern myself about them.<br>If you're a priest, get thee to a temple.</body></html>
