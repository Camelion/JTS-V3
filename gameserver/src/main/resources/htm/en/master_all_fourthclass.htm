Haven't you already achieved a position of renown? <br>The time is coming when you must begin to concern yourself with the future of this world and its inhabitants rather than merely your own development. <br>Someday, when your quest is completed, I hope you will return here to help train future generations of our guild members. Until then, patience! I know your mind will be abuzz with questions. </body></html>
