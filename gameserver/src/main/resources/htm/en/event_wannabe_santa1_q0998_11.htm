<html><head><body>Santa Trainee:<br>You want a Christmas present? Unfortunately, since I am only a Santa Trainee, I don't have anything to give to you. The only gift I have is this <font color="LEVEL">Agathion Seal Bracelet</font>, and only  someone who demonstrates love for others deserves to wear it. Hmm...what should we do?<br>Aha! I know -- I am in the middle of gathering Christmas trees for some poor neighbors. Help me gather <font color="LEVEL">10 ordinary Christmas trees</font> and I'll give you an Agathion Seal Bracelet. What do you say? Will you go gather 10 ordinary Christmas trees for me?<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=998&reply=22">"I have gathered 10 ordinary Christmas trees!"</a></body></html>
