<html><head><body>Priest of Resurrection:<br>Wait, don't say anything!  You... wish to be resurrected. No I cannot read your mind, however your corpse was a big hint. Through horrid and unspeakable acts only I know the secret to resurrection. Seriously, there are somethings you just can't unsee... they haunt my memories.<br><br>I shall spare you the agony and twisted tasks that I endured to learn the secret or resurrection. Provide me what what I require and you shall live... again! Go and get me-- you have no idea what is required? Really? Gather 50 "Proofs of Time and Space" and 10 "Books of Resurrection." Bring me these items so that you may live again!<br><br><br><br><br><a action="link resurrection_priest001.htm">Back.</a></body></html>
