<body>Black Cat:<br>Finally, someone useful. Go meet with Klaus. He came the closest, out of all the challengers. I head that he's wasting his time fishing and drinking in Goddard Castle Town after failing the challenge and becoming a wreck like me. He'll help you with the first clue about the forbidden power. Try to make my dream come true this time.
<br>Also, this is what I've written down about the monster that crippled me, so it will be helpful for you to read.
<br>Now, don't even think about coming back until you have that power in your hand!</body></html>
