<body>Sandra:<br>Do you have the high-quality coin collection book? It's no longer for sale. Too many collectors dilute the market. You must do me a favor if you really want a book. It shouldn't be too hard for you, but there's no way I could do it. Will you help me?<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=381&reply=1">"I'll help you."</a> </body></html>
