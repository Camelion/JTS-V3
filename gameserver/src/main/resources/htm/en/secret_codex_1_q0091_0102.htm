<html><body>Tablet of Vision:<br>
The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by bright lights. While you are holding the tablet to work on it,  you start to acquire a new sense of knowledge, with the voices of thousands of people reading scripture. You realize the truth of the world, yet understand nothing. One of the voices is a familiar female whisper. But it quickly disappears. <br>
Slowly, you begin to visualize where the next Resonance Amulet is... in the valley of dust... you see a second Tablet of Vision... and a female warrior in platinum armor. She is holding the amulet... She then unfolds her wings and flies away along with other female warriors......<br>
In an instant, the images disappear and then the tablet goes completely dark.
