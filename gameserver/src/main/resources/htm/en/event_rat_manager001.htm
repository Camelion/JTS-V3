<html><head><body>Bonny:<br>Greetings, adventurer!<br>I am the granddaughter of the great pirate Zaken. Over the years, many have tried to steal my grandfather's famous treasure. This time the thieves were his very own crew! Can you believe it? Last year's pig fiasco should have taught them that he is not a forgiving man -- he will curse anyone who tries to take what it his. I pity them! Unless something is done, they will be forever trapped as mice! <br><a action="link event_rat_manager002.htm">"How can I help?"</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=1&reply=3">Buy Redemption Bow.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=3&reply=2">Collect reward.</a></body></html>
