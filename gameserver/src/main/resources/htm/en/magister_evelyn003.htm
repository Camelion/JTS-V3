Magister Evelyn:<br>You've put me in a difficult situation. You realize that, don't you? My ancestors who recklessly taught magic to Humans more than a millenium ago paid a high price for their generosity. Since then my people have decreed that Elven magics can only be taught to Elves.<br>I could do nothing, even if I wanted to. Go find a master more appropriate for your race and class.</body></html>
