<html><head><body>Magister Guyder:<br>We believe that the monsters suitable for souls acquisition from the Watcher's Tomb are <font color="LEVEL">Maluk Knights, Maluk Berserkers, Maluk Lords, Limal Karinnesses, Kariks, Pytan Knights and Pytans</font>. <br>Souls cannot be extracted from the monsters that are not as strong as these, so it is of no use trying to collect souls from the weak. Soul Crystal needs souls of much more powerful monsters once it reaches a certain level. Once it thinks that there are no more souls being collected, you'd better find stronger monsters. </body></html>
