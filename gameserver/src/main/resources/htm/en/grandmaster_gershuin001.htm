Grand Master Gershwin:<br>Welcome, brave Kamael warrior, welcome! I am Gershwin, head of the Kamael Guild. How fine to meet a strapping young Kamael like yourself here in the middle of nowhere! I feel like showing you off to the miserable inhabitants of this place, to show them what a real adventurer looks like.
<br>You have truly brightened my day. Please let me know if I can help you in your journey.
