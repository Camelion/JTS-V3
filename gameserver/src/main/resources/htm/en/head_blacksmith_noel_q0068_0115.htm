<html><head><body> Head Blacksmith Noel:<br>Mona, eh? You've come for the key?  Did she lose it again? I'm sorry, but I don't have any spare keys made right now. <br>Is this urgent? You realize that it's not something I can make easily. I must use cast iron to make the basic frame and then shave it down to add detail. However, there is a step that requires it to be cooled down, and I'll need ice crystals to do it. I don't have enough to spare at the moment, but if you can bring me some additional ice crystals I'll make the key for you right away. <br>I hear that you can get ice crystals from Chef Jeremy in the Hot Springs region. Unless you know of another source, I'd go ask him if I were you. </body></html>
