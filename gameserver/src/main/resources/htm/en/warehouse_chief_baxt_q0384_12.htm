<html><head><body>Warehouse Chief Baxt:<br>I've arranged 9 numbers on the panel. Don't peek! Ha ha ha!<br>Please give me your 100 medals. Some players run away when they realize that they don't stand a good chance of winning. Therefore, I prefer to hold the medals before the game starts. If you quit during game play, you'll forfeit your bet. Is that satisfactory?<br>Now, select your first number. <br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=384&reply=10">1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=384&reply=11">2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=384&reply=12">3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=384&reply=13">4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=384&reply=14">5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=384&reply=15">6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=384&reply=16">7</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=384&reply=17">8</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=384&reply=18">9</a></body></html>
