<body>Tablet of Vision:<BR>The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by bright lights. While you are holding the tablet to work on it,  you start to acquire a new sense of knowledge as you hear the voices of thousands reading scriptures in the background. You now realize the truth of the world and yet understand nothing.  There is a vision of 
a beautiful blonde woman and a knight with black armor. The vision disappears. 
Slowly, you begin to visualize where the next Resonance Amulet is...The Town of Goddard...Master Tobald with the Resonance Amulet appears. He is scratching 
his head. <BR>In an instant, the images disappear and then the tablet goes completely dark.</BODY></HTML>
