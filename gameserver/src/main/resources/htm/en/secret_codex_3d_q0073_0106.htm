<body>Tablet of Vision:
<br>An incomprehensible knowledge digs into your head. You think you hear a woman's voice from somewhere.
<br>And you see the image of a man, in Rune Castle Town's library, standing amid great tomes of knowledge. He is looking at the Resonance Amulet and laughing.
<br>He is Grand Magister Valdis of the Rune Castle Town library.</body></html>
