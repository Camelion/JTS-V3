<html><head><body>Omega's Cat: <br>Participating in the event couldn't be easier. Just give me 50,000 Adena and I'll give you a coffer of shadows.<br>Double-click the coffer to receive your item. If you can afford it, it wouldn't hurt to buy several coffers. <br>There are many types of items you can possibly get: Demon Horns, Mask of Spirits, Mystery Potion, Firecrackers and the Large Firecrackers. <br>You never know which item you'll receive. <br>If you're extremely lucky, you may even find <font color="LEVEL">Level 11 and 12 Soul Crystals</font> inside! <br>But there aren't many of those. If you find one, feel lucky that you have been favored by the netherworld. <br><a action="link event_cat_soccer001.htm">Return </a></body></html>
