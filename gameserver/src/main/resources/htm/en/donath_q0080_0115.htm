Chef Donath:<br>
Hmm...<br>
Legend has it that <font color="LEVEL">Chef Jeremy</font> in <font color="LEVEL">the Hot Springs area</font> has some mysterious substance called Ice Crystals. I've heard that they're very effective in preserving food. Bring me some at once, and I'll cook for you. <br>
You must go and find <font color="LEVEL">Chef Jeremy</font>. He has helped people find <font color="LEVEL">the Ice Crystals</font> in the past.
