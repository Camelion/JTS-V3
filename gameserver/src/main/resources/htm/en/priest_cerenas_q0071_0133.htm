<body>Priest Cerenas :<br>This is the material that I use for my study.  Because the power of Goddess Eva and other powers are swirling in the amulet...<br>And also because this Resonance Amulet is not impossible to get.  Those who have this Resonance Amulet are <font color="LEVEL">Demon Halisha's Inferiors</font>. If you enter the Imperial Tomb, or fight in the Shrine of Loyalty near the Wall of Argos, you will be able to meet the Archon or Inferiors of Halisha.  You can get this amulet if you defeat them.<br>Do you understand?  If you want this amulet, you need to defeat <font color="LEVEL">Halisha's Inferiors or Archon</font>.  The Resonance Amulet will let you know where the fifth tablet is. </body></html>
