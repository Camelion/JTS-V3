<HTML><HEAD><BODY>Fishing guild member Linneaus:<br>Fishing is very popular among nobel people these days. The members of our fishing guild enjoys the the act of fishing itself, but noble people use special batis to catch special things.<br>It's banned to sell those kinds of special baits to general public, but I think a famous mercernary like you is more than qualified. Of course it's totally illegal to sell a special bait to you, but it's not a problem at all to make one if you bring me the materials. I heard this bait doesn't catch fish, but it does find treasure chests. A nobleman found some strange boxes that look like treasure chests using this bait. In the box were various material items, letters to someone, accessories, and many more. Certainly these chests can earn you more money than fishing. So I invented a bait after some research. It uses the forces of attraction and repulsion to make fishing more fun.  Would you find me materials for this special bate?<br><a action="bypass -h quest_accept?quest_id=<?quest_id?>">Yes, I will.</a></BODY></HTML>
