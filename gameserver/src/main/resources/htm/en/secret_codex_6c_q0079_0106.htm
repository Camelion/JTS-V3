<body>Tablet of Vision:
<br>You feel something enter your body and combine with energy that was already waiting inside. At that moment, another vision unfolds.
<br>You feel the joy, pain, anger and love of the countless people who challenged this power.
<br>Their emotions are like an overwhelming flood, and you scream.
<br>But it is a scream within your mind without your mouth opening.
<br>You are swept away by these other feelings, and your own awareness slowly disappears.
<br>...
<br>...
<br>The awareness that didn't belong to you returns.
<br>Your mouth moves without your knowing.<br>"Is this the end?"</body></html>
